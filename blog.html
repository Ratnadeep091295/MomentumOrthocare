                                    The AI-empowered active automatic robot CUVIS acts as an additional pair of eyes to the surgeons and provides more accuracy in surgery and can be more beneficial for elderly & high-risk patients explains Dr. Santosh Kumar, the Doyen of Joint Replacement Surgery in Eastern India.

                                    Till date, passive and semi-active robots have been used in different orthopaedic surgeries. Now, the advancement of technology has tied a knot with medical science for the betterment of mankind. Keeping this in mind Kolkata’s leading orthopaedic surgeon & pioneer of joint replacement surgery in Eastern India Dr Santosh Kumar now introduces in Eastern India, AI-powered active automatic robot for joint replacement surgery. Active robots like CUVIS has an active automatic robotic arm which allows for pre-planning, simulation, size and orientation along with pre-operative determination and finally executes the bone preparation according to plan with zero error. It does all the steps of surgery automatically and the surgeon controls the robot with a hand-held remote. Though the whole process will be done by this active automatic robot the whole procedure will be controlled by the team of efficient orthopaedic surgeons led by Dr. Santosh Kumar himself.

                                        Human eyes can’t distinguish two points closer than a millimetre but the robot can accurately assess measurements till one tenth of a millimetre. So, a surgeon can perform the joint replacement more precisely with utmost submillimeter accuracy.

                                        Customized alignment is also another USP of using CUVIS in surgery This is achieved with ultra-high precision in active robotic knee replacement. This restores the stability of walking. Thus, it’s a safer technology.

                                         CUVIS also accelerates post-operative recovery because of its minimally invasive approach, smooth bone cuts, customized placement of implants, less blood loss and less pain, the recovery is accelerated. It has a higher longevity for the implant.

                                    <span class="dr-color">Dr Santosh Kumar:</span> Joint replacement is the surgery to uplift the quality of life and to restore painless and stable movement. It should be done whenever it is needed. The timing when a patient should undertake a joint replacement surgery is very critical. Specifically, in India, where there is general reluctance amongst the common people to undertake a major surgery due to fear and lack of awareness.One must understand that painless and stable movement is needed most when person has social and professional life. . One needs to consider joint replacement whenever the activities of daily living are impaired, irrespective of the age. So I have done joint replacements as young as 25 years and as old as 85 years. Delaying joint replacement makes the execution of surgery more difficult and delays recovery. The biggest problem is the depression that can creep in due to restricted lifestyle and the inability to perform basic activities. Again on contrary a procedure performed earlier than required will put a patient at risk of a revision surgery to the later part of their life. Thus, to summarise it can be said that the timing to perform a joint replacement surgery is very significant and the correct determination of this can result in a outcome that will last a lifetime.

                                </p>
                                <p class="mt-3">
                                    <span class="dr-color">Dr Santosh Kumar:</span> Before you consider surgery, your doctor will usually encourage you to try various non-surgical treatments. These may include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>physical therapy</li>
                                    <li>weight loss (if required)</li>
                                    <li>anti-inflammatory medication)</li>
                                </ul>
                                     However, if the symptoms become worse and start to affect your quality of life, surgery may be the best option. Thus, it’s better to ask yourself whether you have tried all the options and still your knee or hip is preventing you from enjoying life at its fullest or not. If a Total Knee Replacement (TKR) or Total Hip Replacement (THR)  is necessary, delaying or declining -surgery for a long period of time could result in the need for a more complex operation and a less favourable outcome.

Hip Fracture is of two types Intracapsular and Extrascapular.  In Intracapsular fracture replacement surgery is opted and for Extrascapular fracture we have to fix it with screws. Arthritis again categorized in two types. One is age related wear and tear which is less in India as compared to the Western World. Other is specific types of arthritis which are seen on young people like ankylosing spondylitis, avascular necrosis. Another common problem is fracture of neck of femur.

                                    <span class="dr-color">Dr Santosh Kumar:</span>Hip replacement implants can be cemented or uncemented.  When the bone is weaker, we use cemented implants. When bones are strong, press fit calcium hydroxiapatite coated implants are used. This calcium hydroxiapatite coating leads to bone ingrowth which ensures prolong life of implants to enable the person for greater range of movement  and to do all normal activities. Current practice is use of Dual Mobility Hip Replacement. In dual mobility hip replacement, the head size of the implant is large which enables a person to sit cross legged, running jogging and play non-contact sports, cycling, swimming and trekking.
